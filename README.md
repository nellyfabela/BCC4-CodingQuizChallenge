## BCChallenge04
ITESM Bootcamp Software Development Challenge04

## Description

This has been the most challenging assignament so far, my work started as a Frankestein, getting pieces from all over the internet information specially for JavaScript, I notice it if my main opportunity area. I'm currently stryggling with organizing the date when you want to go from one page to another, meaning that also the API is involved and I should be spending more time on it. I also understood that even the past challenge was easy for me, this made it complicated since it involved so much more than just one button, it involved much more buttons and that each one of them have a different impact. Definitely need to redo this challenge and understand by trial and error what I could be doing better.

## Installation

For this Challenge I used mainly VSCode for creating the website from scratch as well as internet broswers. 

## UserStudy 
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## Usage

The website is looking so far like this, which is not the final result.. we'll get better and it'll get fixed.
